This project examines the impact of Oakland's Slow Streets program, which closed off select streets to traffic between June 2020 and February 2022, 
on pedestrian and cyclist traffic crashes. It tests the difference in number of crashes on Slow Streets, defined by a 40-meter buffer around the street,
and contiguous non-Slow Streets, defined as a 200-meter buffer, controlling for local traffic effects and time effects (primarily the impact of the
COVID lockdown).

We find that Slow Streets had a small impact on reducing traffic deaths, but the difference is not significant due to small sample size.

Further updates will include:
• analysis of which individual Slow Streets had a greater effect on reducing traffic, including analyzing demographic and local traffic factors
• crash type comparison
• road condition comparison
• direction/time of day comparison (to examine the effect of sun blinding)
